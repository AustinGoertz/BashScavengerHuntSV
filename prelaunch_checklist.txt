PRELAUNCH CHECKLIST:

The directory structure is organized in its entirety.
The ship has enough fuel to do significant exploration of our cosmos. (If not, you should review task 1 and ensure fuel_up.py has been executed.)

This part of the game uses the c programming language to do something very similar to the Python part; You are not allowed to advance in the game until your directory structure is properly organized.

C is a compiled language, which means it is converted to an executable file, written in machine code.

We then run the executable file. This code will prompt you to enter directories. You can get the current directory of your folder by using pwd. You will need the directory of your fuel folder, so I suggest you copy it before executing the launch script.

Should there be too many files in the directory, remove all that should not be there. There should be a total of three after compilation; the source code, the compiled executable, and this txt file.

COMPILE; gcc -mconsole [source_code_file_name] - o [launch]

This will name the executable "launch."
